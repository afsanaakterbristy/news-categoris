       <h5>1.Differences between var, let, and const.</h5>
       <p>Ans.Var can be declared without initialization and it can be declared without initialization.
        Let can be declared without initialization and it can be declared without initialization. 
        Const cannot be declared without initialization and it cannot be declared without initialization.</p>
       <h5>2.Different between arrow function and regular function.</h5>
       <p>Ans.An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise
        syntax for writing function expressions. Both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner,there are certain differences between them.Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular
        functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable
        and not constructible, arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.
        </p>
       <h5>3.Difference between map ,filter, forEach and find in javascript.</h5>
       <p>Ans.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the
       elements that return truthy for the criteria.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns
       undefined.And The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.</p>
       <h5>4.Why we are use template literals in javascript?</h5>
       <p>Ans.Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.</p>
